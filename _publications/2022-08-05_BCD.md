[Abstract] <br>
The online video service market is expanding day by day as the demand for video services has exploded in recent years. Compared to the growth of other platforms, the growth of video platform services is very rapid. Nevertheless, studies on platform selection and continued use intention are insufficient. This study studies the factors that affect the user’s continuance intention of video platforms. The influence of each factor on users’ use of platform services was analyzed using the Information Systems Success Model and Technology Acceptance Model. As a result of the analysis, it was found that system quality, information quality, and service quality had a significant effect on perceived fun, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. In addition, it was found that perceived fun, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness all had a significant effect on continued use intention. <br>
