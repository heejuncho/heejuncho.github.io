[Abstract] <br>
In South Korea, although companies are creating many business outcomes by building infrastructure for smart manufacturing through the smart factory construction projects, which has been promoted by the government since 2015, the levels of smartization of most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are still remaining at the basic level of basic steps. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted on the factors affecting the intention to continue to use smart factories and net impacts with large enterprises (including public enterprises), strong medium enterprises, and SMEs that have built and have been operating smart factories. This study prepared a questionnaire targeting executives and employees working at companies with a research model that combines the IS success model, the TOE model, and the UTAUT2 model on how companies that built and are using smart factories will be affected when they use the smart factories with an intention to continue to use smart factories and conducted empirical analyses. <be>
