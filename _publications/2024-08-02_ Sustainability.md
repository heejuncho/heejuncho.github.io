**Abstract:** <br>
Many manufacturing industries today are adopting sustainable production methods in response to environmental regulations and efforts. One of the typical criteria they consider is the United Nations has set global objectives (Sustainable Development Goals: SDGs) designed to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges. “Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns” (Goal 12) is one of these goals. As a result, not only are manufacturers interested in sustainable products, but consumers are also showing increased interest. Consequently, the market size for sustainable products is also on the rise. This study aims to examine the mechanisms of how to improve customer loyalty of South Korean consumers who have experience purchasing sustainable apparel to vitalize the sustainable product market in Korea. Specifically, this study reveals the impact of perceived value (PV) on loyalty (LY), focusing on the mediating effects of satisfaction (SAT) and trust (TR). The analysis finds that functional value (FV), emotional value (EMV), and green value (GV) have significant direct effects on LY. Additionally, SAT and TR have significant mediating effects between PV and LY, and there is no difference in the strength of the indirect effects of SAT and TR in the relationship between FV, EMV, GV, and LY. This study extends the theoretical background of the mechanisms enhancing loyalty to sustainable apparel through the verification of parallel mediating effects. Furthermore, it is expected that these insights will serve as a direction for the operational strategies of sustainable apparel manufacturing companies. <br>
